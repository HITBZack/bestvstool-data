# DeWalt DCF860 Review: High-Torque Powerhouse with Pro-Level Performance  

DeWalt has finally answered the call for a higher-performance impact driver, and the **DCF860 20V Max High Torque Impact Driver** delivers in a big way. With a massive jump in torque, faster speeds, and smart design refinements, this tool aims to reclaim a top spot among the most powerful impact drivers available.  

---
- **Top Speeds:** 1,800 / 2,500 / 3,800 RPM  
- **Impact Rate:** 4,500 IPM  
- **Max Torque:** 1,250 / 2,150 / 2,500 in-lbs  
- **Collet Size:** 1/4 in. hex  

### Big Performance Boost  
The DCF860 brings **675 in-lbs more torque** than the DCF845, topping out at **2,500 in-lbs**. That’s a serious leap forward for DeWalt’s 20V lineup. With higher RPMs and IPM, it now competes directly with heavy-hitters like Milwaukee’s M18 Fuel and Flex’s 24V FX1371.  

### Competitor Comparison  

| Model | Top Speed | Impact Rate | Max Torque |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **DeWalt DCF860** | 3,800 RPM | 4,500 IPM | 2,500 in-lbs |
| Flex 24V FX1371A | 4,000 RPM | 4,450 IPM | 2,500 in-lbs |
| Makita 40V Max XGT GDT01 | 3,700 RPM | 4,400 IPM | 1,950 in-lbs |
| Milwaukee M18 Fuel 2953 | 3,900 RPM | 4,400 IPM | 2,000 in-lbs |

## Hands-On Testing  
We ran a series of demanding tests, including driving **8-inch GRK RSS screws** and **3/8 x 8-inch lag bolts** into stacked OSB subflooring.  

- **RSS Screws:** Averaged 7.17 seconds (beating the DCF845’s 8.63 seconds).  
- **Lag Bolts:** Just over 6 seconds (versus the DCF845’s 9.06 seconds).  

It also chewed through **4 inches of OSB with a 1-inch spade bit**, proving it has muscle beyond traditional fastening tasks.  

---

## Design and Build Quality  
- **Weight:** 2.7 lbs (bare), 4.6 lbs (with 8.0Ah PowerPack)  
- **Head Length:** 4.8 in.  

Despite the boost in power, the DCF860 actually got **shorter** than the DCF845 (4.8" vs 5.1"). It’s still not as compact as the Atomic DCF850, but the trade-off in performance is well worth it.  

### Weight with Different Batteries  
- **2.0Ah:** 3.2 lbs  
- **5.0Ah:** 3.8 lbs  
- **5.0Ah PowerStack:** 3.9 lbs  
- **8.0Ah PowerPack:** 4.6 lbs  

Even with the larger batteries, the tool stays balanced and comfortable for extended use.

## LED Work Light Upgrade  
DeWalt went big here, replacing the usual 3 LEDs with **nine LEDs around the collet**. You can cycle through four settings:  

- Low (20 seconds)  
- High (20 seconds)  
- High (20 minutes)  
- Off  

This is one of the best work light systems we’ve seen on an impact driver.  

---

## Price and Warranty  
- **Bare Tool:** $199.99  
- **Kit (8.0Ah PowerPack + charger):** $319.99  
- **Warranty:** 3-year limited warranty, 1-year service, 90-day money-back guarantee  

---

## Pros and Cons  

**Pros**  
- Huge jump in torque and speed vs. DCF845  
- Compact 4.8" head length  
- Excellent 3-speed control  
- Nine-LED work light with 20-min mode  
- Well-balanced, even with larger batteries  

**Cons**  
- Slightly heavier than previous model  

---

## Bottom Line  
The **DeWalt DCF860 20V Max High Torque Impact Driver** is one of the most exciting upgrades in DeWalt’s lineup in years. It delivers top-tier torque, competitive speed, and a pro-focused design that makes it a true flagship. For contractors and serious DIYers, it’s an easy recommendation.
