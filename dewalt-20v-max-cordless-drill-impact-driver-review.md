# DEWALT 20V MAX Cordless Drill & Impact Driver Combo Kit Review

DEWALT’s 20V MAX combo kit gives you the classic two-tool setup most people reach for. For about $149 you get a compact drill, a beefy little impact driver, two batteries, a charger, and a handy bag. It is not flashy, but it does the job, and it does it well.

---

## Key Specs & Features

- **Drill model:** DCD771, two speed transmission 0 to 450 and 0 to 1500 RPM.  
- **Impact driver model:** DCF885, compact 5.55 inch front-to-back length.  
- **Power:** Drill motor rated roughly 300 UWO, which translates to solid everyday torque.  
- **Chucks:** 1/2 inch single sleeve ratcheting chuck on the drill and one-handed 1/4 inch hex chuck on the driver.  
- **Lights:** Driver has a 3 LED ring with a 20 second delay for better visibility.  
- **Package:** Two 20V batteries, charger, and a polyester carry bag.  
- **Weight and size:** Tools are light and compact, designed to fit into tight areas and be easy to use overhead or one handed.

## Performance & Usability

Out of the box the kit feels like what you expect from DEWALT. The drill gives you smooth, predictable speed control which helps when you are starting screws or drilling into trim. The impact driver is small and fast, perfect for driving long screws quickly or working on automotive projects.

Both tools sit nicely in the hand. The ergonomics are good and the balance makes them pleasant for longer tasks. The LED ring on the driver is a surprisingly useful touch when you are under a sink or in a dark corner. Battery life is solid for everyday jobs, though if you are doing heavy work you will want higher amp hour packs.

Some users praise the kit for outlasting cheaper brands like Ryobi in real world use. Others reported isolated durability problems. That is worth noting, but most owners I spoke with use these tools weekly and have not had issues.

## Unique Test / Real-World Use

We tossed this set into a moving day test and a few shop projects. The drill handled furniture assembly and hanging with no drama. The impact driver chewed through lag screws and deck screws with ease, and the three LED lights made alignment simple when working under cabinets.

A few customer reports mentioned an odd smell coming from the impact driver fan during initial use. It was not reported as a safety hazard but it did make one reviewer’s spouse step away during operation. Another user noted the value of the included bag over a hard case when trying to carry a compact set and a few hand tools.

If you want a kit for general house projects, building, and occasional heavier tasks, this set covers most bases. If you plan on long stretches of framing or commercial use, consider upgrading to larger packs or a pro-grade kit.

---

## Value & Context

At around $149 this kit is an easy recommendation for new homeowners, renters, or anyone building a portable starter set. DEWALT brings brand reliability and a performance level that beats many similarly priced combos.

The weak spots are not universal. Some buyers saw battery or tool failures early, while most reported many months of solid use. There is only one charger in the box, which can be a small inconvenience if both batteries are in heavy rotation. For big projects the fix is simple. Buy another charger or upgrade to higher capacity batteries.

Overall the value equation is strong. You get real power, compact form factor, and a setup that is ready to work right away.

## Final Thoughts

The **DEWALT 20V MAX drill and impact driver kit** is one of those purchases that makes life easier. It is compact, powerful, and comes with everything you need to get started. For around $149 it is one of the best bang for your buck combos on the market.

If you are buying a first serious kit, or you want a dependable backup for the truck or shed, this one is a safe bet. Keep an eye out for the occasional odd smell and consider buying a second charger if you plan to run both batteries hard. Otherwise it is a reliable, practical, and frankly fun little set to own.
