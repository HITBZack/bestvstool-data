# Stihl GTA 26 Wood Cutter Review

The **Stihl GTA 26** looks like a toy at first glance — a pocket-sized chainsaw with a 4-inch guide bar. But don’t let the size fool you. This cordless pruner is a powerhouse for light yard work, firewood prep, and DIY tasks where a full-size chainsaw feels like overkill.  

At just 3.2 lbs with the battery, it’s one of the easiest cutting tools you can throw in a bag, holster, or garage shelf. And despite its size, it delivers sharp, fast cuts with the same Stihl reliability you’d expect from their bigger saws.

---

## Key Specs & Features

- **Type:** Cordless (AS 2 battery, 10.8V)  
- **Guide Bar:** 4-inch light bar with chain guard  
- **Weight:** 3.2 lbs (with battery)  
- **Runtime:** ~1 hour intermittent use  
- **Safety:** Trigger lockout, retractable guard, limit stop  
- **Kit Includes:** Carry case, charger, oil, AS 2 battery, scabbard  

The **GTA 26 kit** feels well thought-out. The carry case is neat and compact, and the holster is surprisingly practical when you’re moving between trimming jobs.

---

## Performance & Usability

For pruning, trimming, and small firewood cutting, this little saw punches above its weight. Branches up to 4 cm cut cleanly with minimal effort, and even thicker 8–12 cm limbs can be tackled if you’re patient.  

What makes it shine is **control and comfort**: rubber grips, low vibration, and safety features make it approachable for people who’d normally avoid chainsaws. It’s quick to start, easy to handle, and less fatiguing than lugging a bigger tool.  

Downsides? The chain can snag on small twigs, and runtime is limited if you’re working nonstop. A spare battery is almost mandatory if you’re tackling a full yard.

## Unique Test / Real-World Use

I used the GTA 26 on a mature cherry tree and some overgrown shrubs. For the branches under 4 inches, it was a smooth experience. Clean cuts, little resistance, and minimal wrist strain. On thicker logs, it slowed down but still got the job done.  

It also proved perfect for **firewood prep on a narrowboat trip**. Compact enough to store, yet strong enough to handle logs for the stove. That blend of portability and performance makes it feel like a secret weapon for small-space living.

---

## Value & Context

At around **$179 for the full kit**, the GTA 26 is pricier than generic mini saws you’ll find online, but it justifies the cost with **build quality, safety, and brand support**. The carry bag, holster, and included accessories give it a premium feel, while replacement parts and batteries are easy to source.  

If you’re expecting it to replace a full-size chainsaw, you’ll be disappointed. But as a **compact complement tool**, it’s fantastic value.

---

## Final Thoughts

The **Stihl GTA 26** nails what it sets out to do: provide chainsaw cutting power in a compact, approachable, and safe package.  

If you’re a gardener, DIYer, or small-space dweller who needs light-to-medium cutting capability without the hassle (or intimidation) of a full-size chainsaw, this tool is a winner. Just be ready to grab an extra battery if you plan to use it often.
