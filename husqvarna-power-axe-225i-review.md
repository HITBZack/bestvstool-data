# Husqvarna Power Axe 225i Review

The **Husqvarna Power Axe 225i** is a 14-inch cordless chainsaw designed for homeowners who want the convenience of battery power without sacrificing too much cutting capability. At around **$449 with a 4Ah battery and charger included**, it’s not the cheapest cordless option out there, but it brings Husqvarna’s pedigree in chainsaw design to the battery-powered world.

---

## Key Specs & Features

- **Battery:** 40V lithium-ion, 4Ah included  
- **Bar Length:** 14 inches  
- **Motor:** Brushless, with Boost mode (+25% power on demand)  
- **Runtime:** Up to ~2 hours with mixed use (varies with load)  
- **Weight:** 10.5 lbs (about 15% lighter than comparable saws)  
- **Design:** Balanced pass-through battery system  
- **Chain Adjustment:** Tool-free knobs  
- **Extras:** Active cooling system, ergonomic grip, warning light indicators  

Husqvarna also uses an **interchangeable battery system**, so if you already own Husqvarna battery tools, you can swap packs between them.

---

## Performance & Usability

Performance is where this chainsaw surprises. While no battery saw is going to match the raw grunt of a pro-level gas unit, the Power Axe 225i handles **small and mid-size wood cutting with ease**. Boost Mode gives you that extra kick when you hit tougher cuts, and the ergonomic build makes it comfortable for longer sessions.  

At **90 dB or less**, it’s quiet enough that most users won’t bother with ear protection — a far cry from the scream of a 2-stroke engine. Assembly is minimal: add bar oil, charge the battery, and you’re ready to work.

---

## Unique Test / Real-World Use

A user with **50 years of gas chainsaw experience** put this saw through its paces on 6–8 inch elm trees. It didn’t miss a beat, and they noted it worked **as well as their small gas saw but without the hassle of fuel and starts**.  

Another homeowner managed to **fill the back of a Toyota 4Runner with cut wood on a single battery charge**, and others consistently praised its **light weight, quiet operation, and easy tool-free chain adjustments**.  

The only recurring complaint? **Bar oil runs out fast** — you’ll need to top it off almost every battery cycle.

---

## Value & Context

At **$449**, the Husqvarna 225i isn’t cheap — especially when spare batteries cost nearly $200. But for homeowners looking for **a balance of performance, brand reliability, and user-friendly design**, it’s worth the premium.  

Compared to bargain cordless saws, you’re paying for **long-term build quality, ergonomics, and consistency**. It’s not meant for logging or felling large trees, but it excels in yard work, pruning, storm cleanup, and firewood prep.

---

## Final Thoughts

The **Husqvarna Power Axe 225i** is an excellent cordless chainsaw for homeowners who value **light weight, comfort, and reliable performance** over brute force.  

If you want a gas-free saw that feels balanced, cuts efficiently, and won’t wear you out, the 225i is a great pick. Just be prepared to **budget for extra batteries** if you plan on heavy cutting sessions.
